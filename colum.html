                Airbus is a major European aerospace corporation,
                headquartered in Toulouse, France.<br>

                2. It was founded in 1970 as a consortium of French,
                German, and Spanish aerospace companies.<br>
                3. The company produces a wide range of commercial
                aircraft, from single-aisle planes like the A320 family
                to long-range jets like the A350 XWB.<br>
                4. Airbus is a fierce competitor of Boeing in the global
                aircraft manufacturing industry.<br>
                5. One of its most successful aircraft models is the
                A320, known for its fuel efficiency and popularity among
                airlines.<br>
                6. The Airbus A380, a double-deck, wide-body,
                four-engine jet, was the world's largest passenger
                airliner until its production ended in 2021.<br>
                7. The A220, formerly known as the Bombardier CSeries,
                is a smaller single-aisle aircraft acquired by Airbus in
                2018.<br>
                8. Airbus also manufactures military aircraft,
                helicopters, and satellites.
                As of 2021, Airbus had over 100,000 employees worldwide.<br>
                10. The company operates production facilities in
                several countries, including France, Germany, Spain, the
                UK, and the United States.<br>
                11. The Airbus A350 XWB features advanced composite
                materials and aerodynamics, enhancing fuel efficiency
                and passenger comfort.<br>
                12. In 2020, Airbus introduced the A321XLR, an
                extended-range version of the A321neo capable of flying
                up to 4,700 nautical miles.<br>
                <!-- 13. The Airbus Beluga, or A300-600ST, is a unique cargo aircraft designed to transport large airplane components between production sites.
                        14. Airbus has a significant presence in the Chinese market, with partnerships and industrial cooperation in the country. -->

                1. The Airbus A320neo is a fuel-efficient and advanced
                version
                of the A320 family of narrow-body aircraft. <br>
                2. "NEO" stands for "New Engine Option," featuring more
                efficient engines, including the Pratt & Whitney PW1000G and
                CFM
                International LEAP-1A. <br>
                3. It offers reduced fuel consumption, lower CO2 emissions,
                and
                a quieter operation than previous A320 models. <br>
                4. The A320neo has an extended range of up to 3,850 nautical
                miles, making it suitable for both short-haul and
                medium-haul
                routes. <br>
                5. With the incorporation of advanced technologies, it
                boasts
                improved aerodynamics and wingtip devices called
                "sharklets."
                <br>
                6. The aircraft can accommodate between 140 to 240
                passengers,
                depending on its configuration. <br>
                7. Its first flight took place on September 25, 2014, and it
                entered commercial service in January 2016 with Lufthansa.
                <br>
                8. The A320neo competes with Boeing's 737 MAX series in the
                narrow-body, single-aisle market segment. <br>
                9. The aircraft has become a popular choice for many
                airlines
                worldwide, with numerous orders and deliveries. <br>
                10. Airlines can choose between two engine options, the
                PW1100G-JM or LEAP-1A, to power the A320neo. <br>
                11. Advanced avionics and cockpit technology, such as the
                Airbus
                A320neo's Glass Cockpit, enhance pilot efficiency and
                safety.
                <br>
                12. The A320neo retains high commonality with its
                predecessor,
                the A320ceo, reducing training costs for pilots and
                maintenance
                crews. <br>
